3;Concerns After Biden Refuses to Eat His Food;Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden’s nurse is concerned for his health as he has refused to eat his mush for the fourth time this week. “After giving him his morning formaldehyde drip I tried to feed Joe, he just closed his mouth and grunted some words I did not understand, something about me being ‘full of s***!’ and Joe just put on an angry face, keeping his mouth shut,” Biden’s nurse, Janine Cotillero, told MSNBC. Biden’s campaign manager was also concerned for his candidate, and suggested they might have to feed Biden with a tube. “We need him on the podium at the rallies, just feed him, do what you gotta do, put the tube in his ass if you have to,” Miles Rundringer, Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign manager told his nurse, according to reports. Currently, Biden is leading the Democrat race to beat Donald Trump in November’s U.S. election. The Democrats who control the U.S. media, have forbidden anyone to reveal Biden’s true age, however at a recent visit to Redwood National Park in California, a reporter asked Biden how old he is, and he mumbled some incoherent gibberish before pointing at one of the trees, which can live for over 600 years.
1;Man Awakes From Woke Nightmare;The New Jersey man awoke from his woke nightmare yesterday evening whilst being preached at by another woke celebrity on twitter, the social network. “Everyone I know now is a control freak woke activist, everywhere I go to on the internet I am accosted by woke preachers telling everyone how to think and what to say,” the man said from his hiding place.    According to the man, he awoke from his woke nightmare and now appreciates life a lot more.    “Before, I was told that all white people are bad, all people who do not believe in socialism or communism are fascist evil killers, and that anyone who dared to eat meat might as well eat their own children.    “It was a nightmare, everything was racist, every man was a sexist pig who needed to be castrated, and the world was either black or white, there was no grey, there was nothing but socialist labels put on every segment and element of society. I changed my mental model away from their socialist mental prison, and now accept people and things as they are. “I am now thankfully free of the woke nightmare. I am not a cultural Marxist communist, and I do not condone the ‘cancel culture’ and soviet-style censorship of shutting down free speech that is so prevalent of these so-called ‘progressive inclusive socialists’ in the West.” Due to waking up from his woke nightmare prison, the man is now a pariah in his society and no longer has a job, has lost all his friends, and is now a complete outcast — a happy outcast.
2;COVID-19 Coronavirus is Biphasic Like Anthrax – Contracted Multiple Times;A Japanese tour operator has caught the COVID-19 virus twice, and there have been other reports of multiple infections on individuals in China. Instead of creating immunity, the virus can reportedly reinfect an individual and hasten fatal heart failure. Even if an infected patient recovers, the virus has two phases, therefore triggers still exist in the victim’s body and can awaken again with even more deadly effect.  CHINA – 14% of patients who recovered from coronavirus infection test positive again. This means they are let go, to contaminate further.  The implications for the spread of the virus are horrific because this means the body’s immune system somehow does not create immunity to COVID-19 once recovered.  This highly contagious airborne virus is now spreading fast across the globe.  As of today, the virus has reached every continent in the world, and still the infected are travelling via air traffic spreading COVID-19 on a constant basis. The virus stays dormant for a period of 28 days in some individuals, and during this period it is highly contagious, even though the carrier may not show any visible symptoms.  Much of the data from China cannot be trusted and it is feared the death toll is way above the amount they have reported, as is the same now ravaging Iran.  Even if a vaccine is created in 12-18 months, this will not stop the rapid spread of the virus.  The vaccine creation would involve finding a viral sequence that would reliably cause a protective immune-system memory but not trigger an acute inflammatory response that would itself cause symptoms. Thankfully, the Israelis are on it and are getting close to a vaccine.
3;The Age of Reason: How Coronavirus Could Save Planet Earth;“Every day, every hour, Chinese people who may or may not be infected with coronavirus COVID-19 are travelling across the world, visiting cities, flying through airports. In turn, those they infect go to their communities and travel, spreading the virus exponentially. This has been happening since the start of the Wuhan outbreak in late December. This is why initial outbreaks are starting to appear in many major cities across Europe right now, and other parts of the world. “Coronavirus, if it does its job properly could be the saviour of planet earth, and in turn save humanity in the long run if the population is reduced by 90% and kept at a sustainable level. “It may take some time, and the virus may mutate, disappear for a short period before reappearing again. There may be many waves of the virus over decades until an acceptable human population level is met. “The EU must keep the Schengen free travel zone open, global air traffic must continue, and the shopping malls and mass congregation of people must be allowed to continue. “We must leave room for nature, let nature flourish once again, let it breathe again, we must allow what needs to be done to be done, to cleanse the environment and purge the seas of the plastic. “Humanity must be maintained at levels below 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature, and the future world governing body must guide reproduction wisely once the cycle is completed. “The old religions must be replaced with tempered reason and science, and we must unite humanity with a living new language. “The new system that will eventually emerge must protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts, avoiding petty laws and useless officials. All nations must work to resolve external disputes in a world court. We must balance personal rights with social duties, and be responsible for the future generations that will come after us. “Above all we must prize beauty, knowledge and love, seeking harmony with the infinite.”
2,3;British Royal Family Orders Citizens To Leave U.K. Until Prince Charles Recovers;Calling it the “nation’s foremost duty” to protect their 71-year-old heir apparent, the British royal family ordered 67 million citizens Wednesday to evacuate the United Kingdom until Prince Charles recovered from the novel coronavirus. “Starting immediately, all residents are hereby instructed to gather their necessary belongings, cross the border into nearby Europe, and allow Charles at least 14 days to self isolate in his country,” said royal spokeswoman Evelyn Robinson, adding that citizens should quickly board planes, trains, and boats to create a safe distance of 2,000 miles between the Prince of Wales and the nearest commoner. “In the wake of this country’s devastating Covid-19 outbreak, we want to remind all English, Scottish, and Irish nationals that choosing to remain quarantined places Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, for that matter, at an extremely high risk. To the Kingdom of Great Britain, we ask: What would you rather do? Simply take a few days to wade out into the English Channel? Or remain in the country, knowing that if a member of the royal family dies, there will be blood on your hands?” At press time, Robinson ordered all U.K. citizens to be as silent as possible when leaving the country, so as not to awaken Prince Charles from his afternoon nap.
3,1;Seashells Transform Suburban Bathroom Into Tropical Hideaway;A wicker basket filled with seashells and placed on top of a toilet tank has magically transformed Dale and Paula Watson's suburban bathroom into a serene tropical oasis, sources reported Thursday. "I can't believe the difference adding those seashells made," said Paula Watson, who had somehow been transported from a beige, run-of-the-mill bathroom to an unforgettable island paradise thousands of miles from the Greater Cleveland area. "Every time I walk in here now it's like, 'Wow, where am I? Cancún?'" According to household sources, the extraordinary transformation took place at approximately 10:32 a.m., when Watson neatly arranged a handful of seashells inside a round wicker container and looked up to suddenly find herself at a beachside resort where all the troubles of modern life just melted away. The magical seashells, which are able to conjure up the cool, tropical breeze of a seaside cabana, were personally gathered by the couple during a recent trip to Myrtle Beach. "It's like our own little island getaway right at home," said Dale Watson, who stood as if surrounded by palm trees and soft white sand beaches in the spot where there had only been a shower mat and curtain before. "I feel like I should be eating grilled mahimahi right now." "This is the way life should be," Watson added. "Time just slows down in here." Eyewitnesses agreed that by merely gazing upon the seashell centerpiece, one is whisked away to an enchanted garden, lush with exotic flowers, fluttering hummingbirds, and shirtless natives whose brown skin glistens with sweat as they present trays stacked high with pineapple, mango, and tender cuts of pork. Guests of the Watson home have confirmed that visiting the tropical utopia, which is lo≠cated at the end of the hallway, second door on the left, light switch above the sink, is a breathtaking experience they will never forget. Grandmother Ilene Watson, 77, said she could spend the rest of her life in the carefree bathroom environment without complaint. "It's so exotic," the mesmerized septuagenarian said. "Just like when Harold and I used to go traveling after the war." Although delighted with the transformation, Paula Watson said she had plans to improve the 80 square feet of island paradise by adorning the blissful space with vanilla-scented coconut candles, a ceramic clown-fish figurine, and sand-dollar shaped soaps. "I love our secluded little vacation destination, but we can always spruce it up a little," Watson said. "It would be neat to get a large glass container and fill it with beach sand, a piece of coral, and more seashells." "It's like bringing the Pacific Ocean to us!" she added. Watson also admitted she's had her eye on a nautical-themed light-switch-plate cover featuring a seahorse, which would further transform the tropical hideaway into the magnificent kingdom of Atlantis, a stunning underwater realm where dolphins and mermaids dance and play. This is not the first time that Watson's home has undergone such an incredible metamorphosis. In 2004, a framed painting of two deer instantly turned the family den into a rustic hunting lodge, while in 2005, the corner of the living room became an old English cottage after a porcelain tea set and a vase with dried flowers were added to an end table. At press time, the tranquility of the secluded tropical getaway had been shattered when Paula Watson walked in on their 16-year-old son, Christopher, masturbating to an old issue of Good Housekeeping.
3;Man Just Buying One Of Every Cleaning Product In Case Trump Announces It’s Coronavirus Cure;Throwing bottles of bleach, ammonia, and Drano into a cart at his local grocery store, area man Troy Mitchell was reportedly stocking up on one of every cleaning product he could find Wednesday in case President Donald Trump announces it is a coronavirus cure. “I got toilet bowl cleaner, carpet cleaner, Swiffer WetJet refills—you name it—just so me and my family will be ready if the president announces one of these things can treat Chinese virus,” said Mitchell, indiscriminately throwing containers of laundry detergent, Scrubbing Bubbles, grout whitener, steel wool, Febreze, Tilex mold and mildew remover, and laptop screen wipes into the cart, the contents of which rang up to $2,513.67 at checkout. “I’m not getting caught without some oven degreaser should Trump say it’s going to save us, so I better go ahead and grab me a bottle. After this, I’m hitting the hardware store to pick up a 5-gallon bucket of roof sealant to make sure I’m prepared in the event that turns out to be what gets rid of the Wuhan. Could just be 10 or 20 squirts of Windex into each nostril. You never know what might work in a pinch!” At press time, neighbors confirmed Mitchell had been found unresponsive on the floor of his bathroom with several empty aerosol cans of Rust-Oleum wax-and-tar-removing solvent by his head.
1;Trump Seeks To Stimulate Economy By Sending Rare Autographed Photo To Every American;With markets plummeting and many workers losing jobs as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on businesses, President Donald Trump announced Thursday a plan to stimulate the economy by sending a rare autographed 8-by-10-inch glossy photograph of himself to every U.S. resident. “We know people are hurting financially, so in order to assist them at this critical time, I will be sending out these exclusive and very high-quality signed Donald J. Trump headshots to every American,” said the president, explaining that the approximately 330 million recipients of the exclusive collector’s items could sell them for a hefty sum and then use the cash to cover rent, groceries, and medical bills, which would, in turn, pump billions of dollars back into the economy. “Look, I’m a pretty well-known guy, so these things should definitely fetch a nice price and be a huge help to our workers, sustaining them through a difficult moment in our country’s history. All we ask is that you do choose to sell them and spend the money now, for the sake of the economy, rather than holding on to these beautiful, limited-edition keepsakes as they inevitably appreciate in value. This is truly the stimulus we’ve all been waiting for.” At press time, critics had assailed Trump for exploiting a loophole in the new plan that allows him to send large corporations hundreds of thousands of extra autographed photos of himself.
2;Congress Allocates $2 Trillion To Bail Out Struggling Bailout Industry;In order to alleviate the heavy damage the crucial financial sector is facing in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, the United States Congress announced Tuesday that they would be allocating $2 trillion in order to bail out the struggling bailout industry. “The bailout industry is on the brink of failure, so in order to prevent a full-on catastrophe, we are setting aside $2 trillion in order to bail it out,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that the business of giving of massive sums of money to corporations so they can cover their losses is at the very bedrock of the U.S. economic system, and without assistance, the entire bailout industry as we know it could collapse, which could lead to another Great Depression. “During a crisis like this, the bailout industry is often hit the hardest, so we are taking immediate action, as our economy is deeply dependent on the bailout system; if bailouts can’t function, then America can’t function. A cash injection is absolutely necessary to make sure these failing businesses can inject cash into failing businesses.” At press time, Congress had signed a bill to allocate funds to bail out their bailout of the bailout industry.
3;Richard Burr Wondering When Profiting Off Mass Suffering Suddenly Became A Crime In This Country;Admitting he was blindsided by the hysterical reaction to a pretty normal transaction, North Carolina Senator Richard Burr wondered Friday when profiting off mass suffering had suddenly become a crime in this country. “Jesus Christ, when did everyone get so uptight about this? I remember when we used to celebrate people who used their talent and connections to get rich from death and anguish,” said Burr, who claimed what he did was no different than what many successful, patriotic Americans have been doing for hundreds of years. “Even Tucker Carlson is being a little b**** about this. What’s the big deal? Didn’t we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly [Loeffler] and Ron [Johnson] about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What’s the point of being a senator if you can’t profit off the world’s problems? I’m making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil. There’s something seriously wrong with this country.” At press time, Burr announced his intentions to resign after shamefully admitting he only pulled in a 22% return from his insider trading.
